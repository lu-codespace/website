We are a moteley-crew that share two passions: coding and research.
As early career researchers in fields that do not traditionally deal a
whole lot with coding and programming, we identified the need for a
platform where we can openly exchange ideas and learn from each other.
__*CodeSpace*__ is is that that platform.


__*CodeSpace*__  is hosted by the
the Department of Arts and Cultural Sciences in close collaboration with
the Department of Economic History at Lund Universty.
