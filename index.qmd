This newly ceated forum is aimed at early career researchers
primarily from the Humanities and Social sciences to meet and
discuss coding, machine learning and all the tools, techniques
that go along with it -- and of course to write and review
code together.

The initiative behind __*The CodSpace*__ is undertaken by
[Mathias Johansson](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/mathias-johansson)
and
[Philipp Jonas Kreutzer](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/philipp-jonas-kreutzer)
.

The first meeting will be held soon, please get in
