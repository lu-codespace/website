We created __*CodeSpace*__ to be a safe and inclusive space for
discussing coding and research practices, with an emphasis on the coding.
The initiative was created with early career researchers who code in mind,
but we are happy to welcome anyone as we discuss coding and machine learning
practices, intersting tools and review each other's code.

[Mathias Johansson](https://portal.research.lu.se/en/persons/mathias-johansson)
and
