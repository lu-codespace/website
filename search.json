    "text": "We are a moteley-crew that share two passions: coding and research. As early career researchers in fields that do not traditionally deal a whole lot with coding and programming, we identified the need for a platform where we can openly exchange ideas and learn from each other. CodeSpace is is that that platform.\nCodeSpace is hosted by the the Department of Arts and Cultural Sciences in close collaboration with the Department of Economic History at Lund Universty."

    "text": "We created CodeSpace to be a safe and inclusive space for discussing coding and research practices, with an emphasis on the coding. The initiative was created with early career researchers who code in mind, but we are happy to welcome anyone as we discuss coding and machine learning practices, intersting tools and review each otherâ€™s code.\n\nThe The CodeSpace is undertaken by Mathias Johansson and Philipp Jonas Kreutzer.\nGet in contact if you are interested in participating or have any questions about the initiative."
